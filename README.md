## Description
Scribble Board is a program that allows users to draw simple pictures, using their cursor as a drawing point. They can use several different colors, making pixel art reminiscent of Microsoft Paint.

Users can then save and display their images, along with data such as title and description. The images are stored via a custom API, and users are only allowed to access edit or delete functions for pictures they create (however, users will be able to see all images from all users). The ScribbleBoard API utilizes Json Web Tokens for authentication and authorization.

    <summary>Recreate Database</summary>
    
#### ScribbleBoard `appsettings.json` Creation

1. Navigate to the top level of the repository with the command `cd ScribbleBoard.Solution`
2. Navigate into "ScribbleBoard" with git command `cd ScribbleBoard`
3. Create a file in the root directory called `appsettings.json`. 
4. Add `appsettings.json` to `.gitignore`.
5. Insert the following code into `appsettings.json`:
    
``` 
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=scribbleboard_client;uid=root;pwd=YOUR-PASSWORD;"
    }
}
```

5. Replace `YOUR-PASSWORD` with password you selected when installing MySQLWorkbench.
6. In the root directory, run `dotnet ef database update` 
7. In the root directory, run `dotnet ef database restore`

This will recreate the database on your computer, using MySQLWorkbench. 

#### ScribbleBoardAPI `appsettings.json` Creation

1. Navigate to the top level of the repository with the command `cd ScribbleBoard.Solution`
2. Navigate into "ScribbleBoardApi" with git command `cd ScribbleBoardApi`
3. Create a file in the root directory called `appsettings.json`.

5. Insert the following code into `appsettings.json`:

```
{
  "Logging": {
